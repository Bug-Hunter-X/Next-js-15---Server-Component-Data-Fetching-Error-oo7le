# Next.js 15 Server Components Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using server components in Next.js 15: incorrect data fetching leading to unexpected behavior or runtime exceptions.  The issue arises when a server component attempts to access data that is not properly fetched or handled within the component's lifecycle.

## Bug Description
The original `pages/index.js` file (bug.js) uses server components but lacks proper data fetching, potentially resulting in undefined values or errors during rendering.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper asynchronous data fetching using `async/await` or a suitable data fetching library.  This ensures data is available before the component renders, avoiding runtime exceptions.  It also handles potential errors during data retrieval.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the error message in the browser console or application behavior.
5. Compare the original `bug.js` with the corrected `bugSolution.js` to understand the solution.
